# Commit Explanation

**Commit:**  refactore code

**Explanation:**
The commit message says “refactore code” (probably meant “refactor code”). This means the person changed how the code is organized or written without changing what it actually does. The goal is usually to make the code cleaner, easier to understand, or easier to maintain, but not to add any new features or fix bugs.
